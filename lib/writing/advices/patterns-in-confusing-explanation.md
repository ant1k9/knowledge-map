[Patterns in confusing explanation](https://jvns.ca/blog/confusing-explanations/)

*Description*: So why do I find all these explanations so confusing? I decided to try and find out! I came up with a list of 13 patterns that make explanations hard for me to understand.

*Labels*: #Writing

*Examples*:

```
pattern 1: making outdated assumptions about the audience’s knowledge
pattern 2: having inconsistent expectations of the reader’s knowledge
pattern 3: strained analogies
pattern 4: fun illustrations on dry explanations
pattern 5: unrealistic examples
pattern 6: jargon that doesn’t mean anything
pattern 7: missing key information
pattern 8: introducing too many concepts at a time
pattern 9: starting out abstract
pattern 10: unsupported statements
pattern 11: no examples
pattern 12: explaining the “wrong” way to do something without saying it’s wrong
pattern 13: “what” without “why”
```
