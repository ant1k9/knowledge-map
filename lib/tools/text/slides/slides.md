# Welcome to Slides
A terminal based presentation tool

---

## Everything is markdown
In fact, this entire presentation is a markdown file.

---

## Everything happens in your terminal
Create slides and present them without ever leaving your terminal.

---

## Code execution
\```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
  fmt.Println("Execute code directly inside the slides")
}
\```

You can execute code inside your slides by pressing `<C-e>`,
the output of your command will be displayed at the end of the current slide.
