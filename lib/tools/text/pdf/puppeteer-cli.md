*Description*: A general command-line wrapper for puppeteer. Currently only supports one command—`print`—to render a local/or remote HTML file to PDF. Aims to be a easy replacement for the deprecated wkhtmltopdf.

*Labels*: #JavaScript #HTML #PDF

*Examples*:

```bash
$ puppeteer print https://github.com/JarvusInnovations/puppeteer-cli puppeteer-cli.pdf
$ puppeteer screenshot mypage.html myscreenshot.png
```
